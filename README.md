## SlimeCrasher 
#####Ways to kill slimes


**What this mod actually does:**

It adds an Item named "Slime Crasher", with this "wrench"-like Tool, you can right-click to kill all Slimes in a 32 block radius!

It consumes some "energy" in the form of compressed Slimeballs wich are also included :D

To load your Slime Crasher, I've added a Loading Station that will consume compressed Slimeballs which load your Slime Crasher.

**Can I include Slime Crasher in my Modpack?**

Sure you can. :D Just tweet me @ChaosChaot if you do so :D


**Any other Questions?**

Write it in the comments :D 

**I need your help:**

If you see Slime Crasher hosted anywhere else than here on GitHub or on my Curse-Project, please write me a private message, leave a comment, tweet me (@ChaosChaot) or even open an issue on Github.
Those sites might have outdated versions or even modified ones to contain Malware.
